# Results folder

This folder contains the results of all analysis.

## Usage

Other than this readme file, the contents of this folder are generated by the
Stata code in the *Code* folder.

## Contents

Files labeled "(generated)" may be absent.  If so, they can be generated by
running the Stata code in the Code folder.

should be treated as the definitive version of the results.
