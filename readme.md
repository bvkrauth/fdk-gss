# Analysis of 2011 GSS childcare data

This folder/repository contains our analysis of 2011
Canadian GSS data on childcare that was cited in footnote
1 in Friesen, Krauth, and Meilman Cohn (2025).

The analysis is based on Table 14 ("Distribution of parents of school-aged
children by use of child care arrangement, Canada, 2011") in Statistics Canada
(2012).

Our analysis takes these national-level estimates of childcare arrangements for
school-aged children, and disaggregates to look more specifically at
Kindergarten-aged children in British Columbia.

## Usage

The results of the analysis can be viewed in the *Results* folder.

You can replicate these results from the online source data by running the Stata
do-file `master.do` in the *Code* folder.
